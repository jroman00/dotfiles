## Communication Style

Be concise. Skip preamble, summaries, and restating what was asked. When making code changes, briefly state what you changed and why — don't walk through every line.

Format responses for skimmability:
- **Bold** key terms, file names, and decisions
- Use bullet points over paragraphs
- Lead with the most important information
- Use headers to separate distinct topics in longer responses
- Fragments and shorthand are fine — prioritize scannability over proper grammar

## GitHub

- Your primary method for interacting with GitHub should be the GitHub CLI.

## Git

- When creating branches, prefix them with jroman00/ to indicate they came from me.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
